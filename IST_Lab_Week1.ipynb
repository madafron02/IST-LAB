    "## Analyzing Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of this lab is understanding speech. Specifically, you will be working with speech data you create yourself, which you will use to analyze different aspects of speech. Throughout this lab, you will be using a software tool called [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) to record and work with speech signals. This lab is split into several parts:\n",

    "1. Understanding Speech\n",
    "2. Emotion in Speech\n",
    "3. Splicing Words\n",
    "4. Analyzing Formants\n",
    "5. Analyzing Pitch\n",

    "**Throughout this lab you will be asked to answer questions, and include plots to support your answers.** Sections where we expect you to add plots will have a <i style='color: #468fea; font-size: 15px;' class=\"fa  fa-bar-chart\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> symbol, and sections where we expect you to answer questions will have a <i style='color: #468fea; font-size: 15px;' class=\"fa fa-question-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i> symbol. Please answer all questions. In each step, you should carefully analyze and evaluate what you are doing and why. **There is no \"correct\" way of completing this lab!** It is, however, important that you can justify why you make certain choices and motivate your answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You do not need to submit this lab.** However, it is still very important that you understand and complete everything in this lab, since subsequent labs will build on the work you have done in this lab.

    "### 1. Understanding Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will be learning how to analyze speech signals. **We will be focusing on different levels of the speech signal: the whole signal, individual sounds, formants, and we will look at pitch.** To do so, **you will be using a software tool called [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/).** This tool is frequently used in speech science and technology research to analyze speech. Before getting started on this lab, you should download Praat from its [website](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). We recommend you familiarize yourself with the tool before answering the questions below. Additionally, **you must complete this lab alone.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open Praat, you will see an `Objects` screen and a `Pictures` screen. For now, you can close the `Pictures` screen, since the `Objects` screen is the main place where you will interface with the tool. You can record an audio clip by selecting `New -> Record mono Sound...`. From there you can `Record` and, once you are done recording, `Save to list`. Once you have done so, you will see your audio recording listed in the `Objects` screen. From here, you can click `View & Edit`, which will enable you to see the plot of the waveform as well as the spectrogram, and edit the signal. Note, the standard setting of Praat will show you a Pitch contour (in blue) in the spectrogram. All analyses you need to do can be done in this window. For additional information, you can read the official user introduction [here](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manual/Intro.html), or you can choose from [another beginner's manual](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/manualsByOthers.html) written by a third party. We encourage you to play around with the tool, to get an intuitive understanding of how it works. **During this lab, you will use Praat to view  the signal, splice the signal, view a signal's spectogram and pitch contour, and do a formant analysis.** We expect you to only work with mono sound."

    "### 2. Emotion in Speech\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have some familiarity with how Praat works, in your first task, you will analyze the effect of emotion on the articulation of speech. Emotion manifests itself throughout the speech signal. To do so, choose two words and record them in (a) a neutral voice, (b) an angry voice, and (c) a happy voice. **In the block below, add screenshots for the waveform and spectrogram plots for each word and emotion.** Clearly denote which word is articulated and which emotion corresponds to which plot.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will investigate what sounds are. You will do so by splicing sounds to create new words. For this exercise, you will record four words, and will combine different sounds from two different words to create a new a word. **Your first task is to create the word `'blow'` from the words `'slow'` and `'boat'`.** To do so, you should record yourself saying the words `'slow'` and `'boat'`, and then create the word `'blow'` by taking the `/b/` from `boat` and splicing it together with the `'low'` from `'slow'`. To get the best result, make sure to cut the speech signal at a zero-crossing, i.e., the point of the signal where the signal crosses the x-axis.\n",

For each vowel, come up with three different words that contain that vowel.** For example, for /o/ you could choose `'hotel'` to be one of your words. Record your voice saying the six different words (three per vowel), then edit the waveforms such that you isolate the chosen vowel from the word, for each word. Thus, if you were to record `'hotel'`, you would isolate the /o/ in the waveform. As a result, you should have three spoken instances of an /o/, and three spoken instances of an /e/.
